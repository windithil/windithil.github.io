                <p>Welcome to my website. </p>
                <p>I am an engineer with a passion for design and creation.<br></p>
                <p>I have a MSc in flight dynamics & control, and a BSc in aerospace engineering from sharif university of technology.<br>
                
            </p>

   
                <p>I have made this website through experimenting with threejs Javascript library and webgl renderer, thanks to the teachings of <span> <a href="https://bruno-simon.com/" target="_blank">Bruno Simon</a></span> and <span><a href="https://youtube.com/@akella_/" target="_blank">Yuri Artiukh</a></span>.<br>

            <div class="textContainer" id="text-container">
            <p> I conduct academic research in the field of active space debris removal. My work is focused on a specific debri removal method based on flexible momentum exchange principle. The work heavily relies on numerical simulation of the dynamics using Matlab.<br>   
             Over the last couple of years my learning path has drifted towards expanding my coding skills.<br> 
             I have explored programming languages like python and Javascript. I also touched on the topic of web3 and gained some insight into solidity.<br> 
             My most recent adventure is <span><a href="https://ch3ss.io" target="_blank">CH3SS</a></span> as one of the co-founders of the first fully decentralized chess protocol.

                I was fond of engineering and I had the utmost awe for crafts that flew in the air. <br>
                Fortunately I was accepted to aerospace engineering program at <span><a href="https://en.sharif.edu/" target="_blank">Sharif university of technology</a></span> and found the oppurtunity to earn bachelor's degree with the focus on airplane design, concluding it by publishing a <span><a href="https://www.scientific.net/AMM.332.15" target="_blank">paper</a></span> presenting the design of an unmanned exploration plane for martian atmosphere.</p>
                <p>
                Later, I joined the graduate program and earned a master's degree in controls and flight dynamics. I did my thesis on dynamic identification of a coanda effect air vehicle and published the findings in a <span> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7374024/" target="_blank">paper</a></span>, making the cover of IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine.

                I was a curious soul from early years. I was seriously interested in things that worked.
            </p>
                <p>
                My early teenage years were spent reading through a series of books by Isaac Asimov on history of various scientific fields. The experience somehow shaped my life as I was captivated by the life and efforts of scientists.
            </p>
            <p>    
                I spent most of my spare time crafting gadgets I aspired to be inventions and exploring different methods of destroying my toys!
            </p>
                

            <p>    Later, in high school I started making robots with my friends and participated half a dozen robotic competitions. We even earned a runner up title in university tier event with a fire-fighter robot.

            Cool! You are here! I shall thank you for your indulgence.
            Let me now reveal that I'm also interested in psychology, philosophy and a little bit of sociology as well. 
        </p>
            <p>I am deeply influenced by the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche and Carl Jung.<br> 
                My favourite books are<span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thus_Spoke_Zarathustra" target="_blank">Thus Spoke Zarathustra</a></span>
                 and  
                 <span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silmarillion" target="_blank">The Silmarillion</a></span>.</p>


           <p>I'm also fond of music and play a little bit of electric guitar. Sometimes I listen to the same piece of music a thousand times over. For now that song is 
                    <span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihSV3aDfqGo" target="_blank">Ãœber den Sternen</a></span>! it's not a piece for all ears, so listen discretely if you do!
